### Welcome, adventurer!

Hi, my name is Vin√≠cius Lopes and I enjoy creating and delivering digital products that make people's lives easier.

I'm a Software Developer with knowledge in multiple languages and platforms, that had the opportunity to work in multiple areas of software development, from mobile to backend and leading great development teams.
